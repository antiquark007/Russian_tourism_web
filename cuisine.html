        <p>Pelmeni is the Russian version of boiled dumplings, believed to have origins influenced by 
            Chinese merchants who visited Siberia in the 15<sup>th</sup> century. These bite-sized parcels are made 
            from unleavened dough, filled with ground meat like pork, lamb, chicken, or beef, and flavored with onion,
            garlic, pepper, and spices. Often enjoyed in the cold climate, Siberians would freeze pelmeni outdoors in large 
            batches, preserving them for winter.

        <p>If you’ve spent a few days in Russia and are starting to feel guilty about your fresh vegetable intake, 
            you might breathe a sigh of relief to spot Olivie (also called Olivier salad or simply ‘Russian salad’) 
            on a restaurant menu. Prepared for a bit of a shock when the dish arrives as a multi-coloured mountain of 
            diced potatoes, carrots, pickles, peas, eggs, and several kinds of meat, all overdosed in an avalanche of mayo. 
            A salad in the loosest definition of the word, Olivie is neither a healthy nor sophisticated dish, but it is 
            delicious, in a potato salad on steroids sort of way!
