        <h1>The Rich History of Russia & the USSR</h1>
        <p>The USSR (Union of Soviet Socialist Republics) was formed in 1922 after the Russian Revolution of 1917, which
            ended the Tsarist rule and established a communist government. It grew to include several republics and
            became a powerful influence in global politics, economy, and culture until it fell apart in 1991. This led
            to the creation of the Russian Federation and other independent countries, with the USSR's legacy still
            affecting Russia and its former republics today.</p>
